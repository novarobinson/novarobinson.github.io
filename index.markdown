Historian of the modern Middle East with a special focus on women's rights.

My research bridges the fields of Middle Eastern history, women's history, and the history of international governance. I study the changes in the rights vocabularies used by Arab women. My current project uncovers how the internationalization of women's rights at the League of Nations, and later the United Nations, led Arab women to articulate an alternative conceptualization of women's rights.

I have designed and taught numerous courses on Middle Eastern history, the history of women's rights, and global history. Each course emphasizes the encounters between people and the exchanges of ideas and commodities that have shaped the contemporary world system.

I am an Assistant Professor with a joint appointment in History and International Studies. I am also affiliated with the Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies Program. I hold a PhD from Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey and an AB from Dartmouth College. My research has been supported by several fellowships, including a Fulbright.
